# game_maze

A simple maze game inspired by the works of Lewis Carroll.  This is one of a number of simple related games I wrote many years ago originally in nwscriptas part of a moding project for the game Neverwinter Nights.  Once  I get this version polished up and maybe relased on the app stores I will implement the others.

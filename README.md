# Alice in the Hedge Maze

A simple maze game inspired by the works of Lewis Carroll.  This is one of a number of simple related games I wrote many years ago originally in nwscript as part of a mod project for the game Neverwinter Nights.  Once  I get this version polished up and maybe relased on the app stores I will implement the others.
